## GraphQL API

A GraphQL API only has one single endpoint (usually named `/graphql`).

It only receives **POST** requests (the reason for that is **POST** requests have a body, and **GET** ones don't).

It has a query language (DSL) used for telling the server which operation and data is beeing required.

There are two types of operations:

- `query` -> for fetching data
- `mutation` -> for updating data (create, update, delete)

## Running the Application

To run the app simply start both the backend and the frontend `docker-compose` files.

To do that run the following command in both directories (backend and frontend).

The server will be up in PORT `3000` and the SPA app in PORT `3001`.

```sh
docker-compose up
```
