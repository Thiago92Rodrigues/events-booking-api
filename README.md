## How it works

### GraphQL API

A GraphQL API only has one single endpoint (usually named `/graphql`).

It only receives `POST` requests (the reason for that is `POST` requests have a body, and `GET` ones don't).

It has a query language (DSL) used for telling the server which operation and data is being required.

There are two types of operations:

- `query` -> for fetching data
- `mutation` -> for updating data (create, update, delete)

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- `Node.js`<br />
  recommend version 12.10

  `Node` can be installed from `https://nodejs.org/en/`.

- `NPM`:<br />
  recommend version 6.13

  Installing `Node` will also install `NPM` automatically.

- `Docker`:<br />

  `Docker` can be installed from `https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/`.

### Running the Application

To run the app simply start both the backend and the frontend `docker-compose` files.

To do that run the following command in both directories (backend and frontend).

The server will be up in PORT `3000` and the SPA app in PORT `3001`.

```sh
docker-compose up
```
